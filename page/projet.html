    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>
      Over my years of programming and a mind always buzzing with ideas, I have completed many projects. The most notable ones are listed below:
    </p><br><br>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Anubis">Project: Anubis</h3>
      <p>
        This project was requested by a friend attending a competing school. Her team had almost abandoned her, so I helped from A to Z.<br>
        The goal was to create an ARG as a website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with an accompanying video.<br>
        The code is available on my GitHub (link in the Profile).<br>
        Duration: 2 weeks
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Pravda">Project: Pravda</h3>
      <p>
        Pravda is the name of my web server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5.<br>
        I currently use it to host multiple completed projects and store data for associations and other purposes.<br>
        Duration: 1 week
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Ministorium">Project: Ministorium</h3>
      <p>
        As the lead programmer of the Warhammer club (<em>Warhagine</em>), I was asked to code a website to archive played games and compile the rules of different game modes, with the ability to edit articles.<br>
        Duration: 3 weeks
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Division">Project: Division</h3>
      <p>
        One of the projects closest to my heart as it is linked to the biggest coding project of my life.<br>
        Division is a connected watch where SSH and other coding options would be available.<br>
        I created it because the only watches that natively support this are from Google and Apple, and as a student, I do not have the funds to buy them.<br>
        Duration: 2 months (not yet finished)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Vision">Project: Vision</h3>
      <p>
        This project is still at the prototype stage.<br>
        Similar to the Division project, but this time as smart glasses — because the <em>Even G11</em> and <em>Meta Ray-Ban</em> are too expensive.<br>
        Duration: Not started yet
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: Katyusha">Project: Katyusha</h3>
      <p>
        The project that took me the most time: a voice AI developed in Python.<br>
        It can connect to all my devices, perform voice recognition, and function somewhat like ChatGPT.<br>
        Duration: 4 years (still in development)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 data-text="Project: ClapTrap">Project: ClapTrap</h3>
      <p>
        This project is also in the prototype phase. The goal is to integrate Katyusha into a functional robot (inspired by <em>Lego Mindstorms</em>).<br>
        Duration: Not started yet
